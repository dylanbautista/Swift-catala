## Swift Evolution

Shaping the future of Swift is a community effort that anyone can participate in via the [Evolution section of the Swift forums][swift-evolution-forums].
The [Swift evolution process][swift-evolution-process] covers all changes to the Swift language and the public interface of the Swift standard library, including new language features and APIs, changes to existing language features or APIs, removal of existing features, and so on.

See the [Swift evolution review schedule][swift-evolution-reviews]
for current and upcoming proposal reviews.
